The `regplanely` package allows you to create an interactive visualization of a regression model's predictions using just a fitted model object. The visualization is created using the [plotly](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html) library.

Currently, you can visualize:

- Additive models with one numeric outcome variable, and two numeric explanatory variables
- Interaction models with one numeric outcome variable, and two numeric explanatory variables
    
## Installation

Install `regplanely` using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("wjhopper/regplanely")
